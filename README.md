# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project analyzes customer churn behavior in the banking sector using supervised machine learning techniques. We performed end-to-end modeling‚Äîfrom EDA and feature engineering to model training and evaluation‚Äîon a Kaggle dataset of 10,000 bank customers.
Key components include:

Exploratory Analysis: Identified churn patterns by geography, age, account activity, and balance.

Feature Engineering: Standardized numerical features and one-hot encoded categorical variables to improve model interpretability.

Modeling & Evaluation: Trained and compared multiple models‚ÄîLogistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.

Best Performance: The optimized MLP model achieved 76% accuracy and 73% recall, balancing business impact and model performance.
